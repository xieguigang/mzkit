The MwtWinDll.NET program contains utility functions for calculating the
molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids.
It recognizes user-definable abbreviations and custom elemental isotopes.
It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow 
Modeller, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Isotopic Distribution Calculator, 
and Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeller.  To use, simply include the 
DLL in a .NET project.
