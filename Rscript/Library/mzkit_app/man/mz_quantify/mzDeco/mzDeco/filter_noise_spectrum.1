.SH NAME
filter_noise_spectrum \- make filter of the noise spectrum data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIfilter_noise_spectrum(\fBions\fR as any, 
\fBpeaktable\fR as <generic> PeakSet, 
\fBmzdiff\fR as double = 0.1, 
\fBrt_win\fR as double = 30, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
make filter of the noise spectrum data
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBpeaktable\fB \fR\- the peaktable object, is a collection of the @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.Math.xcms2\fR object.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBions\fB \fR\- a collection of the msn level spectrum data. 
.PP
.PP
\fBmzdiff\fB \fR\- the mass tolerance error in data unit delta dalton, 
 apply for matches between the peaktable precursor m/z and the given ion mz value.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBrt_win\fB \fR\- the rt window size for matches the rt. should be in data unit seconds.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
return a vector of clean spectrum object that could find any peak in ms1 table.
 additionally, the noise spectrum data will be set to the attribute named "noise" 
 of the return vector value.
 
 the return value is a vector of @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.Math.Spectra.PeakMs2\fR object, and the noise
 spectrum data is set to the attribute named "noise" of the return value.
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
this function will filter the noise spectrum data from the given 
 msn level spectrum data collection
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
let cleandata = filter_noise_spectrum(peaktable, ions, mzdiff=0.1, rt_win=30);
 # get the noise spectrum data
 let noise = cleandata$noise;
