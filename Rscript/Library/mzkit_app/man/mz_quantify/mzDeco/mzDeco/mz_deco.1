.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Chromatogram data deconvolution
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBms1\fB \fR\- 
 a collection of the ms1 data or the mzpack raw data object, this parameter could also be
 a XIC pool object which contains a collection of the ion XIC data for run deconvolution.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtolerance\fB \fR\- the mass tolerance for extract the XIC data for run deconvolution.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBfeature\fB \fR\- 
 a numeric vector of target feature ion m/z value for extract the XIC data.
. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
a vector of the peak deconvolution data,
 in format of xcms peak table liked or mzkit @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.Math.PeakFeature\fR
 data object.
 
 the result data vector may contains the rt shift data result, where you can get this shift
 value via the \fBrt.shift\fR attribute name, rt shift data model is clr type: @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.Math.RtShift\fR.
