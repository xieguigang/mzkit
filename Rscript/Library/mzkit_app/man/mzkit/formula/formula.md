The chemical formulae toolkit
 
 In chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of presenting information about the chemical proportions of 
 atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, using chemical element symbols, numbers,
 and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) 
 signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and 
 superscripts. A chemical formula is not a chemical name since it does not contain any words. Although a 
 chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical 
 structural formula. Chemical formulae can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of molecules 
 and chemical substances, and are generally more limited in power than chemical names and structural formulae.
> The simplest types of chemical formulae are called empirical formulae, which use letters and numbers indicating
>  the numerical proportions of atoms of each type. Molecular formulae indicate the simple numbers of each type 
>  of atom in a molecule, with no information on structure. For example, the empirical formula for glucose is
>  CH2O (twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon and oxygen), while its molecular formula is C6H12O6 (12 hydrogen 
>  atoms, six carbon and oxygen atoms).
>  
>  Sometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a condensed formula (or condensed molecular 
>  formula, occasionally called a "semi-structural formula"), which conveys additional information about the
>  particular ways in which the atoms are chemically bonded together, either in covalent bonds, ionic bonds, or 
>  various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension. 
>  An example is the condensed molecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH3−CH2−OH or CH3CH2OH. However, 
>  even a condensed chemical formula is necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships 
>  between atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different substituents.
>  
>  Since a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as
>  informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship 
>  between atoms in chemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and chemical formulae,
>  at right). For reasons of structural complexity, a single condensed chemical formula (or semi-structural formula)
>  may correspond to different molecules, known as isomers. For example, glucose shares its molecular formula C6H12O6
>  with a number of other sugars, including fructose, galactose and mannose. Linear equivalent chemical names exist 
>  that can and do specify uniquely any complex structural formula (see chemical nomenclature), but such names must
>  use many terms (words), rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that 
>  define a chemical formula.
>  
>  Chemical formulae may be used in chemical equations to describe chemical reactions and other chemical transformations, 
>  such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulae do not have the full 
>  power of structural formulae to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of 
>  numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus balancing chemical equations so that
>  these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric 
>  charge.
