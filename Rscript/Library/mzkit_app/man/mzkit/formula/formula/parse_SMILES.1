.SH DETAILS
.PP
SMILES denotes a molecular structure as a graph with optional chiral 
 indications. This is essentially the two-dimensional picture chemists
 draw to describe a molecule. SMILES describing only the labeled
 molecular graph (i.e. atoms and bonds, but no chiral or isotopic 
 information) are known as generic SMILES.
