# SMILES

### Simplified molecular-input line-entry system
 
 The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in the 
 form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short
 ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion
 back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules.

 The original SMILES specification was initiated In the 1980S. It has since been 
 modified And extended. In 2007, an open standard called OpenSMILES was developed In
 the open source chemistry community.

+ [parse](SMILES/parse.1) Parse the SMILES molecule structre string
+ [as.formula](SMILES/as.formula.1) 
+ [as.graph](SMILES/as.graph.1) 
+ [atoms](SMILES/atoms.1) get atoms table from the SMILES structure data
+ [links](SMILES/links.1)
