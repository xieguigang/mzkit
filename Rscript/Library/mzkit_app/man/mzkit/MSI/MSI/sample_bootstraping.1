.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIsample_bootstraping(\fBx\fR as any, 
\fBtissue\fR as <generic> TissueRegion[] = \fB<NULL>\fR, 
\fBn\fR as integer = 32, 
\fBcoverage\fR as double = 0.3,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
make expression bootstrapping of the spatial data
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBx\fB \fR\- The target ion layer to run expression bootstraping, it could be
 @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.MsImaging.SingleIonLayer\fR, or the @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.SingleCells.Deconvolute.MzMatrix\fR data matrix for 
 extract the sample dataframe.
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtissue\fB \fR\- A collection of the @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.MsImaging.TissueMorphology.TissueRegion\fR object.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBn\fB \fR\- Get n sample points for each tissue region. 
.PP
.PP
\fBcoverage\fB \fR\- The region area coverage for the bootstrapping.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
For a single ion data layer, this function generates A tuple list object that contains 
 the expression data for each @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.MsImaging.TissueMorphology.TissueRegion\fR:
 
 1. the tuple key is the label of the tissue region data,
 2. the tuple value is the numeric expression vector that sampling from 
    the corrisponding tissue region, the vector size is equals to the 
    parameter \fBn\fR.
    
 For a raw spatial data matrix @\fBT:BioNovoGene.Analytical.MassSpectrometry.SingleCells.Deconvolute.MzMatrix\fR object, a tuple list object that
 contains two elements will be generats:
 
 1. sampleinfo - a collection of the gcmodeller @\fBT:SMRUCC.genomics.GCModeller.Workbench.ExperimentDesigner.SampleInfo\fR for mark the sample spatial source
 2. data - a dataframe that contains the bootstrapping expression data, ion features in rows
           and spatial features sample in columns.

.SH DETAILS
.PP
Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that resamples a single dataset to create
 many simulated samples. This process allows you to calculate standard errors, 
 construct confidence intervals, and perform hypothesis testing for numerous types of
 sample statistics. Bootstrap methods are alternative approaches to traditional 
 hypothesis testing and are notable for being easier to understand and valid for more 
 conditions.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
# demo code for export expression matrix from the spatial raw data
 
 # load spatial rawdata file
 let rawdata = open.mzpack(file = "./rawdata.mzPack");
 # load ion features
 let ions = read.csv("./features.csv", row.names = NULL, check.names = FALSE);
 
 let mz = as.numeric(ions$mz);
 
 print("view of the ion features m/z:");
 print(mz);
 
 # create the aligned matrix data object
 let matrix = MSI::peakMatrix(raw = rawdata,
                              mzError = "da:0.05",
                              ionSet  = mz,
                              raw_matrix = TRUE
 );
 
 # load spatial regions
 let tissue_data = TissueMorphology::loadTissue(file = "tissue_data.cdf");
 
 # finally create the sample bootstrapping result
 let [sampleinfo, data] = MSI::sample_bootstraping(matrix, tissue_data, n = 200, coverage = 0.1);
 
 print(as.data.frame(sampleinfo));
 str(data);
 
 # save expression data as csv files for the downstream data analysis.
 write.csv(data, file = "./expression.csv", row.names = TRUE);
 write.csv(sampleinfo, file = "./sampleinfo.csv");
