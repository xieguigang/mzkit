''' <summary>
''' QSAR, which stands for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship, is a computational
''' methodology used in the fields of chemistry, biology, and pharmacology to analyze and 
''' predict the relationship between the chemical structure of a molecule and its biological
''' activity or properties.
''' 
''' The basic principle of QSAR is that the biological activity of a molecule is related to its
''' physicochemical properties, which can be described by various molecular descriptors. These
''' descriptors can include factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, electronic
''' properties, and structural features like the presence of certain functional groups.
''' 
''' Here's a more detailed breakdown of the QSAR process:
''' 
''' 1. **Data Collection**: A set of compounds with known biological activities is collected. 
'''    This dataset serves as the training set for the QSAR model.
''' 2. **Molecular Descriptors Calculation**: For each compound in the dataset, a series of 
'''    molecular descriptors are calculated. These descriptors quantitatively represent the 
'''    molecular structure and properties.
''' 3. **Model Development**: Statistical or machine learning methods are used to analyze the 
'''    relationship between the molecular descriptors and the biological activities. This results
'''    in a mathematical model that can predict the activity of new compounds based on their descriptors.
''' 4. **Validation**: The developed QSAR model is validated using a separate set of compounds
'''    (the test set) to ensure its predictive power and robustness.
''' 5. **Prediction**: Once validated, the QSAR model can be used to predict the biological 
'''    activities of new or untested compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
'''    
''' QSAR has several applications, including:
''' 
''' - **Drug Discovery**: Predicting the biological activity of potential drug candidates, thereby 
'''   reducing the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested in the lab.
''' - **Environmental Chemistry**: Assessing the toxicity of chemicals and their environmental impact.
''' - **Chemical Safety**: Evaluating the safety of chemicals used in consumer products.
''' 
''' However, QSAR models also have limitations. They are based on the assumption that the molecular 
''' descriptors adequately capture the relevant aspects of molecular structure that influence biological
''' activity. Additionally, the quality of the predictions is highly dependent on the quality and
''' diversity of the training data.
''' 
''' In summary, QSAR is a powerful tool for predicting the biological activities of compounds based 
''' on their chemical structures, with wide-ranging applications in various scientific disciplines.
''' However, it requires careful validation and interpretation to ensure the reliability of its 
''' predictions.

    ''' Morgan fingerprints, also known as circular fingerprints, are a type of molecular fingerprint 
    ''' used in cheminformatics to represent the structure of chemical compounds. The algorithm steps 
    ''' for generating Morgan fingerprints are as follows:
    ''' 
    ''' 1. **Initialization**:
    '''  - Start with the initial set of atoms in the molecule.
    '''  - Assign a unique identifier (e.g., integer) to each atom.
    '''  
    ''' 2. **Atom Environment Encoding**:
    '''  - For each atom, encode its immediate environment, which includes the atom type and the types of its directly connected neighbors.
    '''  - This information can be represented as a string or a hash.
    '''  
    ''' 3. **Iterative Expansion**:
    '''  - Expand the environment encoding iteratively to include atoms further away from the starting atom.
    '''  - In each iteration, update the encoding to include the types of atoms that are two, three, etc., bonds away from the starting atom.
    '''  
    ''' 4. **Hashing**:
    '''  - Convert the environment encoding into a fixed-size integer using a hashing function. This integer represents the fingerprint of the atom's environment.
    '''  - Different atoms in the molecule will have different fingerprints based on their environments.
    '''  
    ''' 5. **Circular Fingerprint Generation**:
    '''  - For each atom, generate a series of fingerprints that represent its environment at different radii (number of bonds away).
    '''  - The final fingerprint for an atom is a combination of these series of fingerprints.
    '''  
    ''' 6. **Molecular Fingerprint**:
    '''  - Combine the fingerprints of all atoms in the molecule to create the final molecular fingerprint.
    '''  - This can be done by taking the bitwise OR of all atom fingerprints, resulting in a single fingerprint that represents the entire molecule.
    '''  
    ''' 7. **Optional Folding**:
    '''  - To reduce the size of the fingerprint, an optional folding step can be applied. This involves 
    '''    dividing the fingerprint into chunks and performing a bitwise XOR operation within each chunk.
    '''    
    ''' 8. **Result**:
    '''  - The final result is a binary vector (or a list of integers) that represents the Morgan fingerprint 
    '''    of the molecule. This fingerprint can be used for similarity searching, clustering, and other 
    '''    cheminformatics tasks.
    '''    
    ''' Morgan fingerprints are particularly useful because they capture the circular nature of molecular
    ''' environments, meaning that the path taken to reach an atom is not as important as the environment 
    ''' around it. This makes them effective for comparing the similarity of molecules based on their 
    ''' structural features.
