    ''' 
    ''' Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, also known as ChEBI, is 
    ''' a chemical database and ontology of molecular entities focused on 
    ''' 'small' chemical compounds, that is part of the Open Biomedical 
    ''' Ontologies (OBO) effort at the European Bioinformatics Institute 
    ''' (EBI). The term "molecular entity" refers to any "constitutionally 
    ''' or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, 
    ''' radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately 
    ''' distinguishable entity". The molecular entities in question are 
    ''' either products of nature or synthetic products which have potential 
    ''' bioactivity. Molecules directly encoded by the genome, such as 
    ''' nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by 
    ''' proteolytic cleavage, are not as a rule included in ChEBI.
    ''' 
    ''' ChEBI uses nomenclature, symbolism And terminology endorsed by the 
    ''' International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) And 
    ''' nomenclature committee Of the International Union Of Biochemistry 
    ''' And Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB).

    ''' <param name="KEGG">KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is 
    ''' a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, 
    ''' diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. KEGG is utilized for 
    ''' bioinformatics research and education, including data analysis in genomics, 
    ''' metagenomics, metabolomics and other omics studies, modeling and simulation 
    ''' in systems biology, and translational research in drug development.
    ''' 
    ''' The KEGG database project was initiated In 1995 by Minoru Kanehisa, 
    ''' professor at the Institute For Chemical Research, Kyoto University, 
    ''' under the Then ongoing Japanese Human Genome Program. Foreseeing the need 
    ''' For a computerized resource that can be used For biological interpretation 
    ''' Of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. 
    ''' It Is a collection Of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing 
    ''' experimental knowledge On metabolism And various other functions Of the 
    ''' cell And the organism. Each pathway map contains a network Of molecular 
    ''' interactions And reactions And Is designed To link genes In the genome 
    ''' To gene products (mostly proteins) In the pathway. This has enabled the 
    ''' analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content In the 
    ''' genome Is compared With the KEGG PATHWAY database To examine which 
    ''' pathways And associated functions are likely To be encoded In the 
    ''' genome.
    ''' 
    ''' According to the developers, KEGG Is a "computer representation" of the 
    ''' biological system. It integrates building blocks And wiring diagrams of 
    ''' the system—more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes And proteins, 
    ''' chemical building blocks of small molecules And reactions, And wiring 
    ''' diagrams of molecular interaction And reaction networks. This concept 
    ''' Is realized in the following databases of KEGG, which are categorized 
    ''' into systems, genomic, chemical, And health information.</param>
    ''' <param name="pubchem">PubChem is a database of chemical molecules and 
    ''' their activities against biological assays. The system is maintained by 
    ''' the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a component of

    ''' Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem can be accessed for free through a web 
    ''' user interface. Millions of compound structures and descriptive datasets 
    ''' can be freely downloaded via FTP. PubChem contains multiple substance descriptions 
    ''' and small molecules with fewer than 100 atoms and 1,000 bonds. More than 
    ''' 80 database vendors contribute to the growing PubChem database.</param>
    ''' <param name="HMDB">The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a comprehensive,

    ''' databases. The HMDB facilitates human metabolomics research, including the 
    ''' identification and characterization of human metabolites using NMR spectroscopy,

    ''' standards (as of August 16, 2022) is provided to facilitate the identification 
    ''' of chemical entities from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. In addition to the 
    ''' identification of known molecules, it is also useful for identifying unknowns using 
    ''' its similarity searching technology. All tandem mass spectrometry data comes from 
    ''' the experimental analysis of standards at multiple collision energies and in both 
    ''' positive and negative ionization modes.
    ''' 
    ''' METLIN serves as a data management system to assist in metabolite And chemical 
    ''' entity identification by providing public access to its repository of comprehensive 
    ''' MS/MS And neutral loss data. METLIN's annotated list of molecular standards include 
    ''' metabolites and other chemical entities, searching METLIN can be done based on a 
    ''' molecule's tandem mass spectrometry data, neutral loss masses, precursor mass, 
    ''' chemical formula, and structure within the METLIN website. Each molecule is linked
    ''' to outside resources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for

    ''' <param name="SMILES">The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is 
    ''' a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of 
    ''' chemical species using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by 
    ''' most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional 
    ''' models of the molecules.
    ''' 
    ''' The original SMILES specification was initiated In the 1980S. It has since been 
    ''' modified And extended. In 2007, an open standard called OpenSMILES was developed 
    ''' In the open source chemistry community.</param>

    ''' common, unprocessed foods. It also contains extensive data on flavour and aroma 
    ''' constituents, food additives as well as positive and negative health effects 
    ''' associated with food constituents. The database contains information on more than
    ''' 28,000 chemicals found in more than 1000 raw or unprocessed food products. The 
    ''' data in FooDB was collected from many sources including textbooks, scientific journals, 
    ''' on-line food composition or nutrient databases, flavour and aroma databases 
    ''' and various on-line metabolomic databases. This literature-derived information has
    ''' been combined with experimentally derived data measured on thousands of compounds 
    ''' from more than 40 very common food products through the Alberta Food Metabolome 
    ''' Project which is led by David S. Wishart. Users are able to browse through the FooDB 
    ''' data by food source, name, descriptors or function. Chemical structures and molecular 
    ''' weights for compounds in FooDB may be searched via a specialized chemical structure 
    ''' search utility. Users are able to view the content of FooDB using two different 
    ''' “Viewing” options: FoodView, which lists foods by their chemical compounds, or ChemView,
    ''' which lists chemicals by their food sources. Knowledge about the precise chemical 
    ''' composition of foods can be used to guide public health policies, assist food companies
