<dd><p>Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)
 
 Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, also known as ChEBI, is 
 a chemical database and ontology of molecular entities focused on 
 'small' chemical compounds, that is part of the Open Biomedical 
 Ontologies (OBO) effort at the European Bioinformatics Institute 
 (EBI). The term "molecular entity" refers to any "constitutionally 
 or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, 
 radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately 
 distinguishable entity". The molecular entities in question are 
 either products of nature or synthetic products which have potential 
 bioactivity. Molecules directly encoded by the genome, such as 
 nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by 
 proteolytic cleavage, are not as a rule included in ChEBI.
 
 ChEBI uses nomenclature, symbolism And terminology endorsed by the 
 International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) And 
 nomenclature committee Of the International Union Of Biochemistry 
 And Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB).</p></dd>


<dt>KEGG</dt>
<dd><p>KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is 
 a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, 
 diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. KEGG is utilized for 
 bioinformatics research and education, including data analysis in genomics, 
 metagenomics, metabolomics and other omics studies, modeling and simulation 
 in systems biology, and translational research in drug development.
 
 The KEGG database project was initiated In 1995 by Minoru Kanehisa, 
 professor at the Institute For Chemical Research, Kyoto University, 
 under the Then ongoing Japanese Human Genome Program. Foreseeing the need 
 For a computerized resource that can be used For biological interpretation 
 Of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. 
 It Is a collection Of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing 
 experimental knowledge On metabolism And various other functions Of the 
 cell And the organism. Each pathway map contains a network Of molecular 
 interactions And reactions And Is designed To link genes In the genome 
 To gene products (mostly proteins) In the pathway. This has enabled the 
 analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content In the 
 genome Is compared With the KEGG PATHWAY database To examine which 
 pathways And associated functions are likely To be encoded In the 
 genome.
 
 According to the developers, KEGG Is a "computer representation" of the 
 biological system. It integrates building blocks And wiring diagrams of 
 the system—more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes And proteins, 
 chemical building blocks of small molecules And reactions, And wiring 
 diagrams of molecular interaction And reaction networks. This concept 
 Is realized in the following databases of KEGG, which are categorized 
 into systems, genomic, chemical, And health information.</p></dd>

 standards (as of August 16, 2022) is provided to facilitate the identification 
 of chemical entities from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. In addition to the 
 identification of known molecules, it is also useful for identifying unknowns using 
 its similarity searching technology. All tandem mass spectrometry data comes from 
 the experimental analysis of standards at multiple collision energies and in both 
 positive and negative ionization modes.
 
 METLIN serves as a data management system to assist in metabolite And chemical 
 entity identification by providing public access to its repository of comprehensive 
 MS/MS And neutral loss data. METLIN's annotated list of molecular standards include 
 metabolites and other chemical entities, searching METLIN can be done based on a 
 molecule's tandem mass spectrometry data, neutral loss masses, precursor mass, 
 chemical formula, and structure within the METLIN website. Each molecule is linked
 to outside resources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for 
 further reference and inquiry. The METLIN database was developed and is maintained 
 solely by the Siuzdak laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute.</p></dd>
