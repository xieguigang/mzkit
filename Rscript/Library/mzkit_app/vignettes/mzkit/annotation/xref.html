<dd><p>Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)</p>

<p>Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, also known as ChEBI, is <br />
 a chemical database and ontology of molecular entities focused on <br />
 'small' chemical compounds, that is part of the Open Biomedical <br />
 Ontologies (OBO) effort at the European Bioinformatics Institute <br />
 (EBI). The term "molecular entity" refers to any "constitutionally <br />
 or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, <br />
 radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately <br />
 distinguishable entity". The molecular entities in question are <br />
 either products of nature or synthetic products which have potential <br />
 bioactivity. Molecules directly encoded by the genome, such as <br />
 nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by <br />
 proteolytic cleavage, are not as a rule included in ChEBI.</p>

<p>ChEBI uses nomenclature, symbolism And terminology endorsed by the <br />
 International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) And <br />
 nomenclature committee Of the International Union Of Biochemistry <br />
 And Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB).</p></dd>


<dt>KEGG</dt>
<dd><p>KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is <br />
 a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, <br />
 diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. KEGG is utilized for <br />
 bioinformatics research and education, including data analysis in genomics, <br />
 metagenomics, metabolomics and other omics studies, modeling and simulation <br />
 in systems biology, and translational research in drug development.</p>

<p>The KEGG database project was initiated In 1995 by Minoru Kanehisa, <br />
 professor at the Institute For Chemical Research, Kyoto University, <br />
 under the Then ongoing Japanese Human Genome Program. Foreseeing the need <br />
 For a computerized resource that can be used For biological interpretation <br />
 Of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. <br />
 It Is a collection Of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing <br />
 experimental knowledge On metabolism And various other functions Of the <br />
 cell And the organism. Each pathway map contains a network Of molecular <br />
 interactions And reactions And Is designed To link genes In the genome <br />
 To gene products (mostly proteins) In the pathway. This has enabled the <br />
 analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content In the <br />
 genome Is compared With the KEGG PATHWAY database To examine which <br />
 pathways And associated functions are likely To be encoded In the <br />
 genome.</p>

<p>According to the developers, KEGG Is a "computer representation" of the <br />
 biological system. It integrates building blocks And wiring diagrams of <br />
 the system—more specifically, genetic building blocks of genes And proteins, <br />
 chemical building blocks of small molecules And reactions, And wiring <br />
 diagrams of molecular interaction And reaction networks. This concept <br />
 Is realized in the following databases of KEGG, which are categorized <br />
 into systems, genomic, chemical, And health information.</p></dd>


<dt>pubchem</dt>
<dd><p>PubChem is a database of chemical molecules and <br />
 their activities against biological assays. The system is maintained by <br />
 the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a component of <br />
 the National Library of Medicine, which is part of the United States National <br />
 Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem can be accessed for free through a web <br />
 user interface. Millions of compound structures and descriptive datasets <br />
 can be freely downloaded via FTP. PubChem contains multiple substance descriptions <br />
 and small molecules with fewer than 100 atoms and 1,000 bonds. More than <br />
 80 database vendors contribute to the growing PubChem database.</p></dd>


<dt>HMDB</dt>
<dd><p>The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a comprehensive, <br />
 high-quality, freely accessible, online database of small molecule metabolites <br />
 found in the human body. It bas been created by the Human Metabolome Project <br />
 funded by Genome Canada and is one of the first dedicated metabolomics <br />
 databases. The HMDB facilitates human metabolomics research, including the <br />
 identification and characterization of human metabolites using NMR spectroscopy, <br />
 GC-MS spectrometry and LC/MS spectrometry. To aid in this discovery process, <br />
 the HMDB contains three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and <br />
 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data (Fig. 1–3). The chemical data includes <br />
 41,514 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions along with nearly <br />
 10,000 NMR, GC-MS and LC/MS spectra.</p></dd>


<dt>metlin</dt>
<dd><p>The METLIN Metabolite and Chemical Entity Database is the <br />
 largest repository of experimental tandem mass spectrometry and neutral loss data <br />
 acquired from standards. The tandem mass spectrometry data on over 870,000 molecular <br />
 standards (as of August 16, 2022) is provided to facilitate the identification <br />
 of chemical entities from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. In addition to the <br />
 identification of known molecules, it is also useful for identifying unknowns using <br />
 its similarity searching technology. All tandem mass spectrometry data comes from <br />
 the experimental analysis of standards at multiple collision energies and in both <br />
 positive and negative ionization modes.</p>

<p>METLIN serves as a data management system to assist in metabolite And chemical <br />
 entity identification by providing public access to its repository of comprehensive <br />
 MS/MS And neutral loss data. METLIN's annotated list of molecular standards include <br />
 metabolites and other chemical entities, searching METLIN can be done based on a <br />
 molecule's tandem mass spectrometry data, neutral loss masses, precursor mass, <br />
 chemical formula, and structure within the METLIN website. Each molecule is linked<br />
 to outside resources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for <br />
 further reference and inquiry. The METLIN database was developed and is maintained <br />
 solely by the Siuzdak laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute.</p></dd>


<dt>DrugBank</dt>
<dd><p>The DrugBank database is a comprehensive, freely accessible, <br />
 online database containing information on drugs and drug targets created and maintained <br />
