        <h2>Morgan fingerprints, also known as circular fingerprints, are a type of molecular fingerprint</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>used in cheminformatics to represent the structure of chemical compounds. The algorithm steps <br /> for generating Morgan fingerprints are as follows:<br /> <br /> 1. <strong>Initialization<em></em>:<br />  - Start with the initial set of atoms in the molecule.<br />  - Assign a unique identifier (e.g., integer) to each atom.<br />  <br /> 2. <em></em>Atom Environment Encoding<em></em>:<br />  - For each atom, encode its immediate environment, which includes the atom type and the types of its directly connected neighbors.<br />  - This information can be represented as a string or a hash.<br />  <br /> 3. <em></em>Iterative Expansion<em></em>:<br />  - Expand the environment encoding iteratively to include atoms further away from the starting atom.<br />  - In each iteration, update the encoding to include the types of atoms that are two, three, etc., bonds away from the starting atom.<br />  <br /> 4. <em></em>Hashing<em></em>:<br />  - Convert the environment encoding into a fixed-size integer using a hashing function. This integer represents the fingerprint of the atom's environment.<br />  - Different atoms in the molecule will have different fingerprints based on their environments.<br />  <br /> 5. <em></em>Circular Fingerprint Generation<em></em>:<br />  - For each atom, generate a series of fingerprints that represent its environment at different radii (number of bonds away).<br />  - The final fingerprint for an atom is a combination of these series of fingerprints.<br />  <br /> 6. <em></em>Molecular Fingerprint<em></em>:<br />  - Combine the fingerprints of all atoms in the molecule to create the final molecular fingerprint.<br />  - This can be done by taking the bitwise OR of all atom fingerprints, resulting in a single fingerprint that represents the entire molecule.<br />  <br /> 7. <em></em>Optional Folding<em></em>:<br />  - To reduce the size of the fingerprint, an optional folding step can be applied. This involves <br />    dividing the fingerprint into chunks and performing a bitwise XOR operation within each chunk.<br />    <br /> 8. <em></em>Result</strong>:<br />  - The final result is a binary vector (or a list of integers) that represents the Morgan fingerprint <br />    of the molecule. This fingerprint can be used for similarity searching, clustering, and other <br />    cheminformatics tasks.<br />    <br /> Morgan fingerprints are particularly useful because they capture the circular nature of molecular<br /> environments, meaning that the path taken to reach an atom is not as important as the environment <br /> around it. This makes them effective for comparing the similarity of molecules based on their <br /> structural features.</p>
