        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>An interface for provides the exact mass value</p>

<p>The mass recorded by a mass spectrometer can refer to different physical 
 quantities depending on the characteristics of the instrument and the 
 manner in which the mass spectrum is displayed.
 
 ## Units
 
 The dalton(symbol: Da) Is the standard unit that Is used for indicating 
 mass on an atomic Or molecular scale (atomic mass).[1] The unified atomic 
 mass unit (symbol: u) Is equivalent to the dalton. One dalton Is 
 approximately the mass of one a single proton Or neutron.[2] The unified 
 atomic mass unit has a value of 1.660538921(73)×10−27 kg.[3] The amu 
 without the "unified" prefix Is an obsolete unit based on oxygen, which 
 was replaced in 1961.
 
 ## Molecular mass</p>

<p>Theoretical isotope distribution For the molecular ion Of caffeine
 The molecular mass (abbreviated Mr) Of a substance, formerly also called 
 molecular weight And abbreviated As MW, Is the mass Of one molecule Of 
 that substance, relative To the unified atomic mass unit u (equal To 1/12 
 the mass Of one atom Of 12C). Due To this relativity, the molecular mass 
 Of a substance Is commonly referred To As the relative molecular mass, 
 And abbreviated To Mr.
 
 ## Average mass
 
 The average mass Of a molecule Is obtained by summing the average atomic 
 masses Of the constituent elements. For example, the average mass Of 
 natural water With formula H2O Is 
 
 1.00794 + 1.00794 + 15.9994 = 18.01528 Da.
 
 ## Mass number
 
 The mass number, also called the nucleon number, Is the number Of protons 
 And neutrons In an atomic nucleus. The mass number Is unique For Each 
 isotope Of an element And Is written either after the element name Or As 
 a superscript To the left Of an element's symbol. For example, carbon-12 
 (12C) has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
 
 ## Nominal mass
 
 The nominal mass For an element Is the mass number Of its most abundant 
 naturally occurring stable isotope, And For an ion Or molecule, the nominal 
 mass Is the sum Of the nominal masses Of the constituent atoms.[4][5] 
 Isotope abundances are tabulated by IUPAC:[6] for example carbon has two 
 stable isotopes 12C at 98.9% natural abundance And 13C at 1.1% natural 
 abundance, thus the nominal mass of carbon Is 12. The nominal mass Is Not 
 always the lowest mass number, for example iron has isotopes 54Fe, 56Fe, 
 57Fe, And 58Fe with abundances 6%, 92%, 2%, And 0.3%, respectively, And a 
 nominal mass of 56 Da. For a molecule, the nominal mass Is obtained by 
 summing the nominal masses of the constituent elements, for example water 
 has two hydrogen atoms with nominal mass 1 Da And one oxygen atom with nominal 
 mass 16 Da, therefore the nominal mass of H2O Is 18 Da.
 
 In mass spectrometry, the difference between the nominal mass And the 
 monoisotopic mass Is the mass defect.[7] This differs from the definition 
 of mass defect used in physics which Is the difference between the mass of
 a composite particle And the sum of the masses of its constituent parts.[8]
 
 ## Accurate mass
 
 The accurate mass (more appropriately, the measured accurate mass[9]) Is an 
 experimentally determined mass that allows the elemental composition To be 
 determined.[10] For molecules With mass below 200 Da, 5 ppm accuracy Is often 
 sufficient To uniquely determine the elemental composition.[11]
 
 ## Exact mass
 
 The exact mass Of an isotopic species (more appropriately, the calculated 
 exact mass[9]) Is obtained by summing the masses Of the individual isotopes 
 Of the molecule. For example, the exact mass Of water containing two hydrogen-1 
 (1H) And one oxygen-16 (16O) Is 1.0078 + 1.0078 + 15.9949 = 18.0105 Da. 
 The exact mass Of heavy water, containing two hydrogen-2 (deuterium Or 2H) 
 And one oxygen-16 (16O) Is 2.0141 + 2.0141 + 15.9949 = 20.0229 Da.</p>

<p>When an exact mass value Is given without specifying an isotopic species, it 
 normally refers to the most abundant isotopic species.
 
 ## Monoisotopic mass
 Main article: monoisotopic mass
 The monoisotopic mass Is the sum Of the masses Of the atoms In a molecule Using 
 the unbound, ground-state, rest mass Of the principal (most abundant) isotope 
 For Each element.[12][5] The monoisotopic mass Of a molecule Or ion Is the exact
 mass obtained Using the principal isotopes. Monoisotopic mass Is typically 
 expressed In daltons.</p>

<p>For typical organic compounds, where the monoisotopic mass Is most commonly used, 
 this also results in the lightest isotope being selected. For some heavier atoms 
 such as iron And argon the principal isotope Is Not the lightest isotope. The 
 mass spectrum peak corresponding To the monoisotopic mass Is often Not observed 
 For large molecules, but can be determined from the isotopic distribution.
 
 ## Most abundant mass</p>

<p>Theoretical isotope distribution For the molecular ion Of glucagon (C153H224N42O50S)
 
 This refers To the mass Of the molecule With the most highly represented isotope 
 distribution, based On the natural abundance Of the isotopes.
 
 ## Isotopomer and isotopologue
 
 Isotopomers (isotopic isomers) are isomers having the same number of each isotopic 
 atom, but differing in the positions of the isotopic atoms.[15] For example, 
 CH3CHDCH3 And CH3CH2CH2D are a pair of structural isotopomers.</p>

<p>Isotopomers should Not be confused With isotopologues, which are chemical species 
 that differ In the isotopic composition Of their molecules Or ions. For example, 
 three isotopologues Of the water molecule With different isotopic composition Of 
 hydrogen are: HOH, HOD And DOD, where D stands for deuterium (2H).
 
 ## Kendrick mass
 
 The Kendrick mass Is a mass obtained by multiplying the measured mass by a numeric
 factor. The Kendrick mass Is used To aid In the identification Of molecules Of similar 
 chemical Structure from peaks In mass spectra.[16][17] The method Of stating mass was 
 suggested In 1963 by the chemist Edward Kendrick.</p>

<p>According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH2 Is defined as 14.000 Da, 
 instead of 14.01565 Da.[18][19]</p>

<p>The Kendrick mass For a family Of compounds F Is given by[20]</p>

<p>Kendrick mass = (observed mass)×nominal mass()exact mass</p>

<p>{\displaystyle {\mbox{Kendrick mass}}~(F)=({\mbox{observed mass}})\times {\frac {{\mbox{nominal mass}}~(F)}{{\mbox{exact mass}}~(F)}}.}
 
 For hydrocarbon analysis, F = CH2.
 
 ## Mass defect (mass spectrometry)
 
 The mass defect used In nuclear physics Is different from its use In mass spectrometry. 
 In nuclear physics, the mass defect Is the difference In the mass Of a composite particle
 And the sum Of the masses Of its component parts. In mass spectrometry the mass defect 
 Is defined As the difference between the exact mass And the nearest Integer mass.[21][22]</p>

<p>The Kendrick mass defect Is the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nearest Integer 
 Kendrick mass.[23]</p>

<p>Mass defect filtering can be used To selectively detect compounds With a mass spectrometer
 based On their chemical composition.[7]
 
 ## Packing fraction (mass spectrometry)</p>

<p>Francis William Aston won the 1922 Nobel Prize In Chemistry For his discovery, by means 
 Of his mass spectrograph, Of isotopes, In a large number Of non-radioactive elements, 
 And For his enunciation Of the whole number rule.[24][25]
 
 The term packing fraction was defined by Aston As the difference Of the measured mass M And 
 the nearest Integer mass I (based On the oxygen-16 mass scale) divided by the quantity 
 comprising the mass number multiplied by ten thousand:[26]</p>

<p>{\displaystyle f={\frac {M-I}{10^{4}\ I}}}.</p>

<p>Aston's early model of nuclear structure (prior to the discovery of the neutron) postulated 
 that the electromagnetic fields of closely packed protons and electrons in the nucleus would 
 interfere and a fraction of the mass would be destroyed.[27] A low packing fraction is 
 indicative of a stable nucleus.[28]
 
 ## Nitrogen rule
 
 The nitrogen rule states that organic compounds containing exclusively hydrogen, carbon, 
 nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, And the halogens either have an odd nominal 
 mass that indicates an odd number Of nitrogen atoms are present Or an even nominal mass that 
 indicates an even number Of nitrogen atoms are present In the molecular ion.[29][30]
 
 ## Prout's hypothesis and the whole number rule
 
 The whole number rule states that the masses Of the isotopes are Integer multiples Of the mass 
 Of the hydrogen atom.[31] The rule Is a modified version Of Prout's hypothesis proposed in 1815, 
 to the effect that atomic weights are multiples of the weight of the hydrogen atom.[32]</p>
