        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>RefMet: A Reference set of Metabolite names</p>

<p>RefMet Naming Conventions
 
 The names used in RefMet are generally based on common, officially accepted terms and 
 incorporate notations which are appropriate for the type of analytical technique used.
 In general, high-throughput untargeted MS experiments are not capable of deducing 
 stereochemistry, double bond position/geometry and sn position (for glycerolipids/
 lycerophospholipids). Secondly, the type of MS technique employed, as well as the mass
 accuacy of the instrument will produce identifications at different levels of detail. 
 For example, MS/MS methods are capable of identifying acyl chain substituents in lipids 
 (e.g. PC 16:0/20:4) whereas MS methods only using precursor ion information might report 
 these ions as "sum-composition" species (e.g. PC 36:4). RefMet covers both types of 
 notations in an effort to enable data-sharing and comparative analysis of metabolomics 
 data, using an analytical chemistry-centric approach.
 
 The "sum-composition" lipid species indicate the number Of carbons And number Of "double
 bond equivalents" (DBE), but Not chain positions Or Double bond regiochemistry And geometry.
 The concept Of a Double bond equivalent unites a range Of chemical functionality which 
 gives rise To isobaric features by mass spectometry. For example a chain containing a ring 
 results In loss Of 2 hydrogen atoms (compared To a linear Structure) And thus has 1 DBE 
 since the mass And molecular formula Is identical To a linear Structure With one Double bond.
 Similarly, conversion Of a hydroxyl group To ketone results In loss Of 2 hydrogen atoms,
 therefore the ketone Is assigned 1 DBE. Where applicable, the number Of oxygen atoms Is added 
 To the abbreviation, separated by a semi-colon. Oxygen atoms In the Class-specific functional
 group (e.g. the carboxylic acid group For fatty acids Or the phospholcholine group For PC) 
 are excluded. In the Case Of sphingolipids, all oxygen atoms apart from the amide oxygen are
 included, In order To discrminate, For example, between 1-deoxyceramides (;O), ceramides (;O2) 
 And phytoceramides (;O3).
 
 Some notes pertaining To different metabolite classes are outlined below.</p>
