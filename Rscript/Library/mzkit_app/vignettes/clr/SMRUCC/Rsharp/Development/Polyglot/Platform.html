        <h3>Description</h3>

        polyglot programming
 
 Polyglot programming is the practice of writing code in multiple 
 languages to capture additional functionality and efficiency not 
 available in a single language. The use of domain specific languages
 (DSLs) has become a standard practice for enterprise application
 development. For example, a mobile development team might employ
 Java, JavaScript and HTML5 to create a fully functional application.
 Other DSLs such as SQL (for data queries), XML (embedded configuration)
 and CSS (document formatting) are often built into enterprise 
 applications as well. One developer may be proficient in multiple 
 languages, or a team with varying language skills may work together 
 to perform polyglot programming.

 Polyglot programming Is considered necessary When a Single, 
 general-purpose language cannot offer the desired level Of functionality 
 Or speed, interact properly With the database Or the desired delivery 
 platform, Or meet End user expectations. Proponents Of polyglot 
 programming contend that Using the most effective language For Each 
 aspect Of a program enables faster development, greater comprehension
 For business stakeholders, And a more optimal End product. However,
 integrating a wide variety Of languages into a Single application may
 entail added complexity. Resource consumption may increase In terms
 Of training, testing And maintenance. Polyglot programming may also
 make code difficult To deploy If operations Is Not familiar With the
 same languages used In development.
