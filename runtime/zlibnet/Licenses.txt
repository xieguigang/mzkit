Stream implementation ported from .NET managed C++ zlib wrapper:

//========================================================================

//
//ZLib .NET Wrapper - Version 1.1.1, May 31st, 2005
//
//Copyright (C) 2004,2005 Dave F. Baskin
//
//This project wraps version 1.2.2 of the ZLib source in a Microsoft .NET
//mixed-mode DLL wrapper.  This should give native performance to the ZLib
//functions while wrapping the compression and decompression functions
//in a .NET-friendly Stream object.  Additional BinaryReader- and
//BinaryWriter-derived classes are also defined to provide thin wrappers
//around the compression Stream object.
//
//There were no changes made to the ZLib source (thus the version number
//of ZLib was not changed).
//
//This software is released under the same ZLib license as the ZLib
//source itself:
